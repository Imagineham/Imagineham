\begin{itemize}
\item Submit on Gradescope within 6 hours of your first access. Please note down the time of your access
now on the top of this page, above the M1 heading.
\item Accesses are logged by the system. Your timeliness is expected.
\item Timestamps in the form of carefully, completely-photographed work sent by email are admissible in
a technical emergency.
\item Do not share or make the exam accessible to anyone other than yourself. Any suspected violation of
this policy will constitute a breach of the Universityâ€™s academic integrity policy and will be reported.
\item You can either type your solutions using LaTeX or scan your handwritten work. You will find a
LaTeX template in the midterm folder. If you are writing by hand, please fill in the solutions in this
template, inserting additional sheets as necessary. This will facilitate the grading.
\item No collaboration and no use of external resources are allowed for this midterm. Any suspected
violation will be investigated and reported. You may consult the textbook, the material and videos
linked from the Canvas Modules page and any notes that you took for the course.
\item If you absolutely need to contact the teaching team, please use a private message on Ed.
