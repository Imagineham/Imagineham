Homework 2

3.1 Consider a few examples of hose and buckets that might be considered as part of
improving a computer switching technology. Starting from our baseline of a hose capable
of 40 liters / minute, and a bucket size of 4 liters, consider several different scenarios for
an “improved” technology, and their impact on the speed that bits can be switched on and
off.


    A Consider smaller, 1-liter buckets. How fast can bits be switched?
        40 bits a minute



    B Consider smaller hoses, 10 liters/minute. How fast can bits be switched?
        2.5 bits a minute


    C Consider smaller, 1-liter buckets, and smaller hoses, 10 liters/minute. How fast can
bits be switched?
        10 bits a min



    D Consider smaller, 1-liter buckets, and faster hoses, 80 liters/minute. How fast can bits
be switched?
    80 bits a min



3.3 Let’s take our example of a hose and buckets to an extreme. Suppose we take the
metric example of a hose (40 liters / minute), and shrink the bucket.

    A How fast can we switch between “1” and “0” (called toggle) a bucket of 1 liter? 100
    millliters? 10 milliliters?

    1 liter -> 40 liters/1 minute * 1 liter/x min = x*40 = 1 = x = 1/40 = 0.025 minutes or 1.5 scenarios
    100 milliliters -> 100 mililiters/x liters = 1000 mililiters/1 liter => x = 1/10 => x = (1/10)/40 = 1/400 = .0025 => .0025 * 60 = .15sec
    10 mililiters -> factor of 10 so .015 sec


    B How about if we increased the hose’s pumping rate; how fast can we toggle a 4-liter
    bucket if the hose is 80 liters / minute? 160 liters/minute?

    80 liters? -> 1 bucket/4 liters = 80 liters/1 minute = 1/20 * minute = 3 seconds
    160 seconds -> half the amount of time for 80 liters = 1.5 seconds


3.4 Consider using the 4-liter volume of water that was used in a bucket to communicate
a bit across a schoolyard. We want to transmit the signal as a rise in the water level across
a distance of 50 meters.

    A How much water is available per meter to communicate the information?
    4 liters/ 50 meters = x liters/1 m => x*50 = 4 => 4/50 = 2/25 = .08liters


    B If we use a trough that is 1 centimeter wide, how tall would it be? (this is the water
level rise that would be read as a “1” at the other end.
    4 liters = H * W * L == 4 liters = H * .01m * 50 m => 1m/1000 liters * 4 liters/(.01 * 50) = .008m

    C Now, using the hose rate of 40 liters / minute, how fast can this trough be used to
communicate a toggle “1 to 0 to 1” across the schoolyard?

    4 liters/40 liters/min -> 1/10 liter per min = 6 seconds


3.5 Using your answer from Problem 3.3, and your common sense, how much faster can
this switching be done by increasing the pumping power of the hose? What is going to
limit the performance?

    Increasing pumping power proportionately decreases switching time, that is, a 2x increase in pumping power
    halves the switching time. The volume of the trough limits performace. It would be best is the trough was smaller
    in volume. 



3.7 The model of a hose and bucket is pretty good analogy for how dynamic random access memory (DRAM) works. As we will see in Chapter 5, DRAM has been the main
type of computer memory used since 1975 (approaching 50 years). However, real DRAM
has several complications – it leaks and the filling and reading of buckets is noisy. Consider a DRAM cell with a capacitance of 1 picofarad (10−12), and a charge pump that can
pump 100 microcoulombs/second (0.1 milli-amp), allowing the cell to be charged in 10
nanoseconds (10x10−09) to 1 volt.

    A The DRAM cells are called “dynamic” because they leak charge, so a “1” will eventually lose enough charge to be considered a “0”. If the cells leak at a rate of 0.01
microcoulombs / second, how long will it take a full cell to leak all of its charge?

        100mC/1 sec * 10x10^-9 = 1x10^-6
        .01 mC/1 sec = 1x10^-6mC/x sec = 1x10^-4 sec

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
    B In practice, DRAM values have to be refreshed (rewritten to ensure they are not lost)
frequently. And, they must be rewrittenn long before their values have decayed to “0”s.
Suppose we can allow the cells to lose 25% of their charge, how long can a DRAM
cell hold the value before it needs to be refreshed?

        .25 * 1x10^-6 = 2.5x10^-7
        .01mC/1 sec = 2.5x10^-7/x => x = 2.5x10^-5 s 


    C  As DRAM cells are scaled to smaller size (producing higher bit density per chip),
balancing these properties is a challenge. If cells are reduced in size by 50%, and their
capacitance decreases by the same factor, what is the problem that arises?

Since capacitance is equivalent to coulombs per volt, the amount of charge that must be provided to these cells must also decrease in order to keep
balance. This implies that if the voltage remained the same, there would be too much charge in these now dense cells which could cause memory hardware to burn up. 


    D Given the problem you’ve just outlined (above), what new capabilities do DRAM technologists need to solve to allow DRAM scaling to higher density? (and lower cost per
bit!)


3.14 The End of Dennard scaling is widely dated to around 2005. Since that time, we
have had to settle for limited versions of the scaling, with lower increases in speed and
decreases in power. Despite that, there have been significant increases in performance (and
increases in performance per power). Pick a line of processors such as the Qualcomm
Snapdragon, Intel Core, or the Apple Ax (A9, A10, A11, A12, A13, A14). Find the processor data sheets or internet information that describes the performance these processors
from 2010 to 2020.

    A How have performance and power scaled of these processors scaled over time?

    B  Estimate how performance and power would have changed if Dennard scaling had
continued, and compare. How much have we lost with the end of Dennard?

    C How much will we lose the next decade if these trends continue at the same rate?

3.18 Just for fun (and to emphasize how exceptional the improvement of computers has
been), consider what would have happened if the same level of size scaling and resulting
benefit worked for internal combustion engines. Consider the 1959 Chevy Corvette, which
had a 290-horsepower engine with a displacement of 283 cubic inches (4.64 liters) and
achieved a 0 to 60 mph time of 6.9 seconds.

    A Suppose we decide to build a smaller engine (1/1,000 in volume or 10x smaller in each
dimension) suitable for a bicycle or small scooter, what power could it produce? and
how fast could it accelerate the scooter from 0 to 60?


    .29?

    B Estimate the fuel efficiency of the resulting scaled Corvette? How does it compare to
todays internal combustion engine cars?
