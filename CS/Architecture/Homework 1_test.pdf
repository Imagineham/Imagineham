Computer Architecture for Scientists (Winter 2021)

Homework #1

Problems from Chapter 1

1.1 Enumerate five devices in your daily life that have computers inside today, but didn’t
20 years ago. For each, explain why computing benefits the device. For the user, and for
the company who sold it.

Nintendo switch
    --> entertainment, wireless controllers, ease of use, targeted playstyles (removing controllers allows for movement games) USER
    --> allows for more diversity in games, games sold, game developers COMPANY
Lightbulbs (bluetooth lights) 
    --> convenience. not having to get up to turn off lights, control light levels, 
Google Home(speakers, radios) 
    --> scheduling, accessibility, convenience USER 
    --> personalizing products, acquriing data baout people's homes/lifestyles for future products COMPANY
Headphones 
    --> accessibility, USER
    --> COMPANY
OMNY (apple pay, transportation) (metrocard)
    --> faster, easier, more convenient. time efficient, less confusing, the object it replaces USER
    --> data, track use, 
Debit card


1.3 The integration of computing and networking have accelerated many activities in
society, e-commerce is one example. Analyze the steps to identify and purchase an article
of clothing in a world without the internet, smartphones, and e-commerce. Analyze the
steps in today’s modern world. Explain how the latency to receive the desired article has
changed. Explain how the time investment required of you has changed.

Without internet, smartphones, e-commerce?
    traveling outside, going to a store, individual, group of individuals, selecting wanted article, purchases with physical currency
    dollars, coins, greeting/goodbye etc etc.  perhaps can try on clothes! can see quality of clothes!

today's modern world?
    google item you  want, where's it sold? many options many websites. can be done on phone, laptop, google home/alexa devices (interactive AI)
    not necessary to meet with people physically, can buy an article of clothing without meeting anyone. but also cannot try on clothes or 
    see quality of clothes

1.6 Another pervasive communication-use of computing is social media. Describe several features of how 
you interact with social media, and how computing is used to create posts, decide when they are visible, 
and even target advertising?

    I'd like to use Discord as my example. Discord is an application that has become one of most popular platforms for gamers to socialize and build community. Started in 2015, 
    Discord placed emphasis on video and audio communication which greatly enticed gamers who wanted an application to play an dtalk with their friend at the same time. Alongside 
    video and audio call, Discord has features where conversations can be grouped into channels, each with rules/facilities that can be controlled. Discord users can control many levels of 
    their experience and this is a result of computing. Primarily, Discord's channels work as an abstraction of the company's databases. When a user creates a channel, 
    
    
    
    facebook groups, polls, voting systems, comments sections, replying to comments, liking disliking hearting posts
    discord, groups, channels, video calls, phone calls, reactions, import own reactions, create reactions
    using discord you can see what others r listening to if enabled, people themselves send promotive content
